## Why did we choose it?
Logan choose this because, he loves pokemon and he wanted to do a Pokemon project for his last Unit Project but, could not figure out a way how and Logan wanted to try a project that will be more diffucult.  RJay choose this because, he likes pokemon, and enjoys trying new ways to make a game.


## Prior Art
Our Inspriations are Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire with the Safari park, where you can go and catch mutiple diffrent Pokemon and Battle Tower, where the user can battle diffrent champions based on what Tower they pick with there being some restrictions. being what our game will be based off of.

## Orignal Thoughts
We were going to make a game where the useer just catches pokemon but, it evovled into a little bit more when we deceid to add moves and the Battle Towers

## Conclusion
We had a lot of fun making the project but, it was really challenging when we had to set up mutiple battles before the Champions so, sadly we had to scrap that and let the player battle the champions as soon as they picked a tower to fight in.

## What we would if we could
Defintly add more pokemon and evlotions to the mix so, that the player has more varity of pokemon to use, as well as adding more moves when they evovled.
Also wanting to add more battles out in the Safari Area would have been great as well, but also wanting to fix the Battle Towers so that there are certain requriments you must meet so that the player has to fill those out
