# Unit 2 Project: Hoenn Safari Park


# Project Description
This Project will be based off of Pokemon Safari Parks and the battle towers from the games serving as challenges for the players to defeat.

# Prior Art
Our Inspriations are Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire with the Safari park and Battle Tower being what our game will be based off of.

# Core User Workflow
The user will set off from the starting area (The Safari Counter) and choose a starter.  From there they can go to mutiple locations and catch pokemon in the wild to fight against opppents in the Battle towers.


# Tuesday thru Thursday Goals:
Tuesday: We will start on structing our code and deciding on what Pokemon to put in and working on our catching function
Wednesday:  Start Making mutliple areas for the player to go to and inplemt random encounters in the areas
Thursday: We will work on proper battle functions for our Battle Towers so that the User can have a challenging battles


# How Will You Utilize The Content Covered This Unit:
First will use lists to contain the Pokemon the player has caught so, that they can retrive them later.  We will use Tuples to contain Pokemon for specific areas in.  We will use Dicts to have player move from area to area.
